MIDDLEWARE

What is Middleware ?
- It is code that runs in the middle of the request / resposne cycle !
- In Express, middleware are functions that get access to the req and res
objects and can also call the 'next' function .
- express.json() is an example of middleware 
- Our 404 and global error handler are example of middleware 


When would you use it ?
It opens up the door for separating our code into more logical groupings
and providing more robust / abstracted error handling .

- Logging useful information on every request 
- Adding a current_user for every request (like g in Flask!)
- Ensuring that users are authenticated 
- Ensuring that a user is authorized to access an endpoint


What does it look like ?
- In another file called middleware.js 
demo/routing-demo/middleware.js 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
function logger(req, res, next){
    console.log(`Sending ${req.method} request to ${req.path}.`);
    return next(); 
}
