ROUTES CONTINUED

The Request-Response Cycle 
When you start a server, Express runs through the file
and registers all the event listeners before app.listen at the bottom.

Whenever a user makes a request, Express invokes the first matching route 
handler it finds until a response is issued via a method on the response object.

This is called the request-response cycle for Express.


Route Methods
Here are the route methods you will likely use, one for each HTTP verb :
- app.get(path, callback)
- app.post(path, callback)
- app.put(path, callback)
- app.patch(path, callback)
- app.delete(path, callback)
