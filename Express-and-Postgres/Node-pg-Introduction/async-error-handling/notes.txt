ASYNC ERROR HANDLING

What's the bug here?
DB queries are asynchronous! We have to wait for the query to finish before!

Having errors in async functions are problematic unless we use try and catch 

When were writing route handler callbacks, we need to use the try catch pattern
so the errors do not break the app!

Catch the errors and call next with that errors
