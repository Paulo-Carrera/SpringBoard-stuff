COMPARING APPROACHES

WHICH IS BETTER ?

- "Simple Class" (no data, only static methods) (cats)
    - Can be easier to write the class 
    - Fewer SQL queries may fire (compare delete between Cat and Dog)
    - Doing more interesting things can be trickier 

- "Smarter Class" (data, real methods) (dogs)
    - Real attributes can be handy !
    - Easier to do validation
    - Can do things like cat.speak() rather than Cat.speak(id) 


Are There ORMs For JavaScript ?
Yes !
There's a nice one called Sequelize
Not as popular as ORMs in other languages, though.
