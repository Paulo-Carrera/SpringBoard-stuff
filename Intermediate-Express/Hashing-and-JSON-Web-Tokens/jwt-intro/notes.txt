JWT INTRO

JSON Web Tokens 

Authentication in Flask (review)
- Make request with username / password to login route
- Server authenticates & puts user info in the session
    - Session is encoded & signed with Flask-specific scheme
- Session info is sent back to browser in cookie 
- Session info is automatically resent with every request via cookie 


Authentication in Flask 
- This works well for traditional web apps & is straightforward to do 
- What if 
    - We didn't want to send auth info with certain requests ?
    - We wanted to share authentication info across multiple APIs / hostnames ?
- We'll use a more API-server friendly process !

"Think of JWTs as a hotel key that can get you into your room, the gym and into elevators.
JWTs and OAuth authenticate a user across multiple web applications / websites."
