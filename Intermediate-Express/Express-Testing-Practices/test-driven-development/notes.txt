TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT

Test Driven Development 
- Write tests first - they will fail !
- Only write the code necessary to get the tests to pass 
- Focus on completing the task/user story at hand 
- As you write more code, keep running tests 
  and make sure they are passing 


Test Driven Development
Red, Green, Refactor
- Your tests will fail (red)
- You write the code to get the tests to pass (green)
- You refactor !
